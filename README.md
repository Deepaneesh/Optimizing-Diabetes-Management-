# **Optimizing Diabetes Management : A Predictive Approach to Medication Effectiveness**

### **Abstract**

This project aims to evaluate the effectiveness of different medications managing blood glucose levels in patients with Type 2 Diabetes, using a synthetic dataset and statistical modelling techniques. Specifically, we compare the effectiveness of Metformin, Glipizide, and Sitagliptin over an 8-week period, with Metformin serving as the control group. By simulating weekly blood glucose levels, we fit ARIMA models to the data to forecast future blood glucose levels and determine how long it takes for the most effective medication to bring glucose levels to a normal range. The study also assesses the accuracy of these forecasts to ensure reliable predictions. Our findings indicate that Glipizide is the most effective in reducing blood glucose levels and we provide detailed accuracy metrics for the forecasting model.

### **Motivation**

The management of Type 2 Diabetes is a critical area of healthcare, given its widespread prevalence and the severe complications associated with poorly controlled blood glucose levels. While numerous medications are available, their comparative effectiveness is not always clear, leading to varied treatment outcomes. This project is motivated by the need to provide a clear, data-driven comparison of popular diabetes medications. By generating and analysing synthetic data, we aim to simulate real-world scenarios and predict treatment outcomes with a high degree of accuracy. This approach not only aids in identifying the most effective medication but also helps in forecasting the time required to achieve optimal blood glucose control, thereby contributing to better-informed treatment decisions and improved patient care.

### **Conclusions**

Our study compared the effectiveness of Glipizide, Metformin, and Sitagliptin in reducing blood glucose levels in Type 2 Diabetes patients. **Glipizide** showed the highest total reduction **(24.5)**, followed by **Sitagliptin (20.7)** and **Metformin (17.6)**. The ARIMA model provided accurate forecasts, with an **MAE of 6.75 and RMSE of 6.76**, predicting glucose normalization within **10 weeks**. These metrics underscore the reliability of the model in predicting future trends.

**Glipizide** is the most effective among the three medication for lowering blood glucose levels, achieving significant reductions and forecasting normalization within **10 weeks**. This study highlights the importance of data-driven approaches in optimizing diabetes management and provides a robust framework for future research and clinicalÂ applications.
